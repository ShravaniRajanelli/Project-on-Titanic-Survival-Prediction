# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is an analysis and prediction task on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, and the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset consists of the following columns:

* PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
* Survived: Binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) 
  or not (0).
* Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
* Name: Passenger's name.
* Sex: Passenger's gender.
* Age: Passenger's age.
* SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
* Parch: Number of parents or children aboard.
* Ticket: Ticket number.
* Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.
* Cabin: Cabin number.
* Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = 
  Southampton).
  
## Problem Statement
The main goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the given features. This is a binary classification problem, and we will use machine learning models to make predictions.

## Analysis Steps

### Data Exploration:
* Investigated the distribution of features.
* Handled missing values and outliers.
* Created visualizations to better understand the data
### Data Preprocessing:
* Encoded categorical variables.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
### Model Selection:
* Explored various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, 
  Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
* Evaluated models using cross-validation.
### Model Evaluation:
* Evaluated the model.
* Assessed performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 
 score.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the testing dataset. Detailed results and insights can be found in the Jupyter notebook file.

## Dependencies
* Python 
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter.
